## Economic Model

### **Capital Efficiency**

- Community provides STX liquidity
- Provider provides bfaktory liquidity
- Combined liquidity earns Alex AMM LP rewards

### **Risk/Reward Distribution**

- **bfaktory Risk**: Price volatility, IL risk
- **Reward**: 60% to STX providers, 40% to bfaktory provider
- **IL Protection**: None (standard AMM IL applies)

### **Provider Incentives**

- 40% reward share for providing bfaktory liquidity
- Early access to unused capital (after entry period)
- Ability to assist with user withdrawals

## Technical Details

### **AMM Integration**

- Uses Alex AMM v2 pools
- Factor: `u100000000` (standard)
- Tokens: wSTX-v2 / wbfaktory pair

### **Precision & Dust**

- Expected dust: ~0.01-0.02% per withdrawal
- Dust is negligible and self-balancing across users

### **Block Time Assumptions**

- ~144 blocks per day (Stacks average)
- Entry period: 3,024 blocks ‚âà 21 days
